# Experiment: trying to reach small MSE values, below 0.15

### Log 0: During the course

never below 0.45. 

## Log1: 20210524 without T-ab, T-tj, T-te

log file "20210524 1.html"

v is very low (0.0001 or something) and kappa is very low (in the order of 1*10e-05)

Re-run with pars-init settings as v1.0 (similar of Venturia canescens). It reached convergence and
kappa value and v was more realistic (20210524 2.html). used mat2pars-init to recycle the parameters found. MRE is still high (0.387)

Tried to remove datapoints of length/wet weight data to see if a better fit could be obtained. Ww0 and Lb seem to be antagonistic (taking one of these out improves fit). Better weight data would be nice to have.

As I have no hopes of getting a better fit in the future, I set this project on hold for now. Better try fitting DEB with another species.
