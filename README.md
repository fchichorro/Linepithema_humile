# Linepithema_humile

Estimation of dynamic-energy budget parameters for the argentine ant, *Linepithema humile* (Mayr, 1868). If successful, this would be the first DEB-parametrized ant species. 

## Background

*Linepithema humile* is in the list of the 100 worst invasive species. It originates from South America and it was brought to virtually every temperate/mediterranean region in the world, where it is invasive. It displaces native species of ants where it occurs due to its aggressivity and high numbers.

## TODO

- update my_data file with egg incubation times, larval and pupal period duration at different temperatures from NewelBarber1913
- (time allowing): larval length-weight and time-length relationships from the literature - maybe within Laurent Keller's publications from the 80-90s

## Questions/issues

- NewelBarber1913 has some data on egg/larval/pupal durations for some temperature values for males and workers, but data on queen larvae is missing. Maybe more recent literature has more info on queen larval development?
- I did not find in the AmPep the trait "larval period duration". How to add this potential relevant information to the my_data file?
